List of bugs:

Major:
  1. Sometimes at the end of game you get this situation:
     ________ 
     __TTT___
     __ZTZ___
     ........

     So, T-block (T) at the top. 
     Trying to add I-block, and get like this:
    
     ___I____ 
     __TIT___
     __ZTZ___
     ........

     So, top-middle T brick changed to brick from I-block...and it GAMEOVER.
     It's not really critical, because in the field is really bad situation, but not good...

Trivial limitations (not good things):
  1. Random generation is not really good: you can get 3-4 the same block in a row.
  2. I think, rotation for S/Z block is not realistic: it could be better.
  3. In the end of game you get some block in the "next block window". At new game this block
     will be first block: it's pretty.

  4. Using a lot ALMs, because:
       * field stored at D-triggers, not RAM.
       * using vga_clk 108 MHz for 1280x1024 -> quartus added retiming registers, and duplicate logic
       * i don't optimize for area

; Logic utilization (in ALMs)     ; 3,352 / 32,070 ( 10 % )                     ;
; Total registers                 ; 2533                                        ;
; Total block memory bits         ; 177,664 / 4,065,280 ( 4 % )                 ;
